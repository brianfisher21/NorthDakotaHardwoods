	<h1>Welcome to North Dakota Hardwoods</h1>
		
		<p>North Dakota Hardwoods was founded in 1985 as a hardwoods specialty shop 
		but as population increase and demand raised we the need for a custom wood 
		shop grew. By utilizing our expertise in hardwoods North Dakota Hardwoods 
		became that very place. Now expanded into a 5,000 sq. ft. shop we specialize 
		in <strong>hardwood flooring</strong>, <strong>top-notch cabinetry</strong>, <strong>high-end stairways</strong> and any other 
		custom job that you throw our way while also keeping to our roots by offering 
		unfinished exotic and domestic hardwoods for the do-it-yourselfer.
